# H.aRchers

H.aRchers is a web application that leverages machine learning to assist in the recruitment process. It uses Logistic Regression to classify and screen candidates by comparing their qualifications to job requirements, considering factors such as experience, education, and skills. Additionally, it incorporates Linear Regression to generate a candidate score, which becomes a parameter in the classification process. Designed to enhance efficiency and precision, H.aRchers provides a structured approach to evaluating candidates against specific job criteria.

## H.aRchers AI Scoring

H.aRchers uses Linear Regression to score candidates by evaluating key factors such as experience, education, and employment gaps. By analyzing these attributes, the model generates a score that helps determine the best-fit candidates for a job, offering an efficient and data-driven approach to candidate selection.

## H.aRchers AI Screening

H.aRchers uses Logistic Regression to classify and screen candidates by comparing their qualifications with job requirements. The system analyzes candidate data such as experience, education, and skills, and uses this information to predict whether a candidate is a good fit for the job. Linear Regression, used earlier to score candidates based on factors like experience and education gaps, feeds directly into this classification process as a parameter. This allows the system to not only screen but also assess candidates with greater accuracy and efficiency.
